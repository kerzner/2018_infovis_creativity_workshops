In applied visualization, reflection transforms engineering into research~\cite{Sedlmair2012}. We use a methodology of critically reflective practice~\cite{Brookfield1998} to analyze our collective experience. Due to the nature of reflective analysis, we recognize that the framework is not exhaustive, predictive, nor objective. Nevertheless, {\it the framework is consistent with our experience, grounded in existing theory, and likely useful for future visualization research.}
