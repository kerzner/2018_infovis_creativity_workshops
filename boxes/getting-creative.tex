The ideas presented in this paper are a starting point for thinking about workshop design. We are excited by the potential for researchers to think creatively about what methods to use and how to tailor them for visualization creativity workshops. In reporting on the effecitveness of methods, we encourage answering the following questions as exemplified by Goodwin et al.~\cite{Goodwin2013}:
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep,noitemsep]
\item {\it What methods were used?}
\item {\it What was the intended result of each method?}
\item {\it What was the real result of each method?}
\item {\it How useful was the method result?}
\end{itemize}


To illustrate the workshop structure, our Supplemental Material includes an example workshop plan which has been adapted and validated in three projects [\ref{wor:eon},~\ref{wor:graffinity},~\ref{wor:cp}]. We include this plan as a starting point for researchers to consider workshops in their own projects.
