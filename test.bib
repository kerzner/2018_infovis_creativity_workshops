  abstract = {We present the design of a novel framework for the visual integration, comparison, and exploration of correlations in spatial and non-spatial geriatric research data. These data are in general high-dimensional and span both the spatial, volumetric domain - through magnetic resonance imaging volumes - and the non-spatial domain, through variables such as age, gender, or walking speed. The visual analysis framework blends medical imaging, mathematical analysis and interactive visualization techniques, and includes the adaptation of Sparse Partial Least Squares and iterated Tikhonov Regularization algorithms to quantify potential neurologymobility connections. A linked-view design geared specifically at interactive visual comparison integrates spatial and abstract visual representations to enable the users to effectively generate and refine hypotheses in a large, multidimensional, and fragmented space. In addition to the domain analysis and design description, we demonstrate the usefulness of this approach on two case studies. Last, we report the lessons learned through the iterative design and evaluation of our approach, in particular those relevant to the design of comparative visualization of spatial and non-spatial data.},

  abstract = {Although visualization design models exist in the literature in the form of higher-level methodological frameworks, these models do not present a clear methodological prescription for the domain characterization step. This work presents a framework and end-to-end model for requirements engineering in problem-driven visualization application design. The framework and model are based on the activity-centered design paradigm, which is an enhancement of human-centered design. The proposed activity-centered approach focuses on user tasks and activities, and allows an explicit link between the requirements engineering process with the abstraction stage-and its evaluation-of existing, higher-level visualization design models. In a departure from existing visualization design models, the resulting model: assigns value to a visualization based on user activities; ranks user tasks before the user data; partitions requirements in activity-related capabilities and nonfunctional characteristics and constraints; and explicitly incorporates the user workflows into the requirements process. A further merit of this model is its explicit integration of functional specifications, a concept this work adapts from the software engineering literature, into the visualization design nested model. A quantitative evaluation using two sets of interdisciplinary projects supports the merits of the activity-centered model. The result is a practical roadmap to the domain characterization step of visualization design for problem-driven data visualization. Following this domain characterization model can help remove a number of pitfalls that have been identified multiple times in the visualization design literature.},

Dense layout and occlusion make food webs, ontologies, and social networks difficult to understand and interact with. We propose a new interactive Visual Analytics component called TreePlus that is based on a tree-style layout. TreePlus reveals the missing graph structure with visualization and interaction while maintaining good readability. To support exploration of the local structure of the graph and gathering of information from the extensive reading of labels, we use a guiding metaphor of "Plant a seed and watch it grow." It allows users to start with a node and expand the graph as needed, which complements the classic overview techniques that can be effective at (but often limited to) revealing clusters. We describe our design goals, describe the interface, and report on a controlled user study with 28 participants comparing TreePlus with a traditional graph interface for six tasks. In general, the advantage of TreePlus over the traditional interface increased as the density of the displayed data increased. Participants also reported higher levels of confidence in their answers with TreePlus and most of them preferred TreePlus.},

Exploring and analyzing the vast volumes of data becomes increasingly difficult. In- formation visualization and visual data mining can help to deal with the flood of information. The advantage of visual data exploration is that the user is directly involved in the data mining process. There is a large number of information visualization techniques which have been developed over the last decade to support the exploration of large data sets. In this paper, we propose a classification of information visu- alization and visual data mining techniques which is based on the data type to be visualized, the visualization technique and the interaction and distortion technique.

  doi = {10.1109/TVCG.2009.152},
  abstract = {We present an interactive framework for exploring space-time and form-function relationships in experimentally collected high-resolution biomechanical data sets. These data describe complex 3D motions (e.g. chewing, walking, flying) performed by animals and humans and captured via high-speed imaging technologies, such as biplane fluoroscopy. In analyzing these 3D biomechanical motions, interactive 3D visualizations are important, in particular, for supporting spatial analysis. However, as researchers in information visualization have pointed out, 2D visualizations can also be effective tools for multi-dimensional data analysis, especially for identifying trends over time. Our approach, therefore, combines techniques from both 3D and 2D visualizations. Specifically, it utilizes a multi-view visualization strategy including a small multiples view of motion sequences, a parallel coordinates view, and detailed 3D inspection views. The resulting framework follows an overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand style of analysis, and it explicitly targets a limitation of current tools, namely, supporting analysis and comparison at the level of a collection of motions rather than sequential analysis of a single or small number of motions. Scientific motion collections appropriate for this style of analysis exist in clinical work in orthopedics and physical rehabilitation, in the study of functional morphology within evolutionary biology, and in other contexts. An application is described based on a collaboration with evolutionary biologists studying the mechanics of chewing motions in pigs. Interactive exploration of data describing a collection of more than one hundred experimentally captured pig chewing cycles is described.},

Our results show that techniques that create separate charts for each time series--such as small multiples and horizon graphs--are generally more efficient for comparisons across time series with a large visual span. On the other hand, shared-space techniques--like standard line graphs--are typically more efficient for comparisons over smaller visual spans where the impact of overlap and clutter is reduced.},

MatrixExplorer provides several novel features to support the exploration of social networks with a matrix-based representation, in addition to the standard interactive filtering and clustering functions. It provides tools to reorder (layout) matrices, to annotate and compare findings across different layouts and find consensus among several clusterings. MatrixExplorer also supports Node-link diagram views which are familiar to most users and remain a convenient way to publish or communicate exploration results.

Unfortunately, the visualizations in existing systems do not satisfactorily resolve the basic dilemma of being readable both for the global structure of the network and also for detailed analysis of local communities. To address this problem, we present NodeTrix, a hybrid representation for networks that combines the advantages of two traditional representations: node-link diagrams are used to show the global structure of a network, while arbitrary portions of the network can be shown as adjacency matrices to better support the analysis of communities. A key contribution is a set of interaction techniques. These allow analysts to create a NodeTrix visualization by dragging selections to and from node-link and matrix forms, and to flexibly manipulate the NodeTrix representation to explore the dataset and create meaningful summary visualizations of their findings. Finally, we present a case study applying NodeTrix to the analysis of the InfoVis 2004 coauthorship dataset to illustrate the capabilities of NodeTrix as both an exploration tool and an effective means of communicating results.},

The goal is to enable a style of design with simulations that feels as-direct-as-possible so users can concentrate on creative design tasks. The approach integrates forward design via direct manipulation of simulation inputs (e.g., geometric properties, applied forces) in the same visual space with inverse design via 'tugging' and reshaping simulation outputs (e.g., scalar fields from finite element analysis (FEA) or computational fluid dynamics (CFD)). The interface includes algorithms for interpreting the intent of users' drag operations relative to parameterized models, morphing arbitrary scalar fields output from FEA and CFD simulations, and in-place interactive ensemble visualization. The inverse design strategy can be extended to use multi-touch input in combination with an as-rigid-as-possible shape manipulation to support rich visual queries. The potential of this new design approach is confirmed via two applications: medical device engineering of a vacuum-assisted biopsy device and visual effects design using a physically based flame simulation.},

However, most studies have mainly focused on layout algorithms and paid limited attention to the interaction with treemaps. This makes it difficult to explore large data sets and to get access to details, especially to those related to the leaves of the trees. We propose the notion of zoomable treemaps (ZTMs), an hybridization between treemaps and zoomable user interfaces that facilitates the navigation in large hierarchical data sets. By providing a consistent set of interaction techniques, ZTMs make it possible for users to browse through very large data sets (e.g., 700,000 nodes dispatched amongst 13 levels). These techniques use the structure of the displayed data to guide the interaction and provide a way to improve interactive navigation in treemaps.},

We introduce Matrix Diagnostics (or MAGNOSTICS), following in spirit related approaches for rating and ranking other visualization techniques, such as Scagnostics for scatter plots. Our approach ranks matrix views according to the appearance of specific visual patterns, such as blocks and lines, indicating the existence of topological motifs in the data, such as clusters, bi-graphs, or central nodes. MAGNOSTICS can be used to analyze, query, or search for visually similar matrices in large collections, or to assess the quality of matrix reordering algorithms. While many feature descriptors for image analyzes exist, there is no evidence how they perform for detecting patterns in matrices. In order to make an informed choice of feature descriptors for matrix diagnostics, we evaluate 30 feature descriptors\textemdash{}27 existing ones and three new descriptors that we designed specifically for MAGNOSTICS\textemdash{}with respect to four criteria: pattern response, pattern variability, pattern sensibility, and pattern discrimination.

Given the rapidly increasing scale, complexity, and rate of change of business ecosystems, as well as economic and competitive pressures, analysts are faced with the formidable task of quickly understanding the fundamental characteristics of these interfirm networks. Existing tools, however, are predominantly query- or list-centric with limited interactive, exploratory capabilities. Guided by a field study of corporate analysts, we have designed and implemented dotlink360, an interactive visualization system that provides capabilities to gain systemic insight into the compositional, temporal, and connective characteristics of business ecosystems. dotlink360 consists of novel, multiple connected views enabling the analyst to explore, discover, and understand interfirm networks for a focal firm, specific market segments or countries, and the entire business ecosystem. System evaluation by a small group of prototypical users shows supporting evidence of the benefits of our approach. This design study contributes to the relatively unexplored, but promising area of exploratory information visualization in market research and business strategy.},

  volume = {19},
  abstract = {In many applications, data tables contain multi-valued attributes that often store the memberships of the table entities to multiple sets such as which languages a person masters, which skills an applicant documents, or which features a product comes with. With a growing number of entities, the resulting element-set membership matrix becomes very rich of information about how these sets overlap. Many analysis tasks targeted at set-typed data are concerned with these overlaps as salient features of such data. This paper presents Radial Sets, a novel visual technique to analyze set memberships for a large number of elements. Our technique uses frequency-based representations to enable quickly finding and analyzing different kinds of overlaps between the sets, and relating these overlaps to other attributes of the table entities. Furthermore, it enables various interactions to select elements of interest, find out if they are over-represented in specific sets or overlaps, and if they exhibit a different distribution for a specific attribute compared to the rest of the elements. These interactions allow formulating highly-expressive visual queries on the elements in terms of their set memberships and attribute values. As we demonstrate via two usage scenarios, Radial Sets enable revealing and analyzing a multitude of overlapping patterns between large sets, beyond the limits of state-of-the-art techniques.},

Such differences are called sequence variants, and determining their impact in the cell is difficult because it requires reasoning about both the type and location of the variant across several levels of biological context. In this design study, we worked with four analysts to design a visualization tool supporting variant impact assessment for three different tasks. We contribute data and task abstractions for the problem of variant impact assessment, and the carefully justified design and implementation of the Variant View tool. Variant View features an information-dense visual encoding that provides maximal information at the overview level, in contrast to the extensive navigation required by currently-prevalent genome browsers. We provide initial evidence that the tool simplified and accelerated workflows for these three tasks through three case studies. Finally, we reflect on the lessons learned in creating and refining data and task abstractions that allow for concise overviews of sprawling information spaces that can reduce or remove the need for the memory-intensive use of navigation.},

Our contribution is a set of guidelines for legend design in a visualization context and a series of illustrative themes through which they may be expressed. These are demonstrated in an applications context through interactive software prototypes. The guidelines are derived from cartographic literature and in liaison with EDINA who provide digital mapping services for UK tertiary education. They enhance approaches to legend design that have evolved for static media with visualization by considering: selection, layout, symbols, position, dynamism and design and process. Broad visualization legend themes include: The Ground Truth Legend, The Legend as Statistical Graphic and The Map is the Legend. Together, these concepts enable us to augment legends with dynamic properties that address specific needs, rethink their nature and role and contribute to a wider re-evaluation of maps as artifacts of usage rather than statements of fact. EDINA has acquired funding to enhance their clients with visualization legends that use these concepts as a consequence of this work. The guidance applies to the design of a wide range of legends and keys used in cartography and information visualization.},

  abstract = {An ongoing debate in the Visualization community concerns the role that visualization types play in data understanding. In human cognition, understanding and memorability are intertwined. As a first step towards being able to ask questions about impact and effectiveness, here we ask: 'What makes a visualization memorable?' We ran the largest scale visualization study to date using 2,070 single-panel visualizations, categorized with visualization type (e.g., bar chart, line graph, etc.), collected from news media sites, government reports, scientific journals, and infographic sources. Each visualization was annotated with additional attributes, including ratings for data-ink ratios and visual densities. Using Amazon's Mechanical Turk, we collected memorability scores for hundreds of these visualizations, and discovered that observers are consistent in which visualizations they find memorable and forgettable. We find intuitive results (e.g., attributes like color and the inclusion of a human recognizable object enhance memorability) and less intuitive results (e.g., common graphs are less memorable than unique visualization types). Altogether our findings suggest that quantifying memorability is a general metric of the utility of information, an essential step towards determining how to design effective visualizations.},

  doi = {10.1109/TVCG.2007.70569},
  abstract = {Perfusion data are dynamic medical image data which characterize the regional blood flow in human tissue. These data bear a great potential in medical diagnosis, since diseases can be better distinguished and detected at an earlier stage compared to static image data. The wide-spread use of perfusion data is hampered by the lack of efficient evaluation methods. For each voxel, a time-intensity curve characterizes the enhancement of a contrast agent. Parameters derived from these curves characterize the perfusion and have to be integrated for diagnosis. The diagnostic evaluation of this multi-field data is challenging and time-consuming due to its complexity. For the visual analysis of such datasets, feature-based approaches allow to reduce the amount of data and direct the user to suspicious areas. We present an interactive visual analysis approach for the evaluation of perfusion data. For this purpose, we integrate statistical methods and interactive feature specification. Correlation analysis and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are applied for dimensionreduction and to achieve a better understanding of the inter-parameter relations. Multiple, linked views facilitate the definition of features by brushing multiple dimensions. The specification result is linked to all views establishing a focus+context style of visualization in 3D. We discuss our approach with respect to clinical datasets from the three major application areas: ischemic stroke diagnosis, breast tumor diagnosis, as well as the diagnosis of the coronary heart disease (CHD). It turns out that the significance of perfusion parameters strongly depends on the individual patient, scanning parameters, and data pre-processing.},

We summarize lessons from related ethnography methods used in HCI and provide guidelines for conducting MILCs for information visualization. We suggest ways to refine the methods for MILCs in modest sized projects and then envision ambitious projects with 3-10 researchers working over 1-3 years to understand individual and organizational use of information visualization by domain experts working at the frontiers of knowledge in their fields},

  abstract = {The field of Participatory Design (PD) has grown rapidly over the last 20 to 30 years. For more than two decades non-designers have been increasingly involved in various design activities through a large number of participatory design projects all over the world. The project aims in PD have developed from being mainly about ICT development to today include, for instance, space design, product development, industrial design, architecture, service- and transformation design. As every project is unique, it is necessary to decide which design approach(es), methods, tools and techniques to use in a specific project. Thus many practices for how to involve people in designing have been used and developed during the years. There is some confusion as to which tools and techniques to use, when, and for what purpose. Therefore we are proposing a framework to help organize the proliferation of tools, techniques and methods in hopes that the PD community will benefit by discussing relevant applications and identifying potential areas for further exploration.},

  abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein-protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD $\leq$ 2.0 \AA{} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

These ideas, on average, were used at least as much as requirements from other sources in writing use cases, and 18 months after the workshop were seen to have a similar degree of influence on the project to other requirements. We make some observations about the use of more and less creative ideas, and about the techniques used to generate them. We end with suggestions for further work.},

Techniques for determining the requirements (functions and qualities) of software have traditionally focused on utility, with a prominent body of work using graphical goal modeling and analysis to ensure that system functions meet the needs (goals) of users. However, these techniques are not designed to foster creativity, meaning that resulting systems may be functionally useful but not sufficiently innovative. Further work has focused on creativity workshops for finding and developing software requirements. However, creative outputs are not grounded in user goals, are not amenable to decision support techniques, and cannot be easily captured by non-experts. In this work we report initial progress on a project aiming to combine goal modeling and creativity techniques for enhanced software Requirements Engineering (RE). We apply our methods to a historical case in air traffic control, providing example outcomes, illustrating the benefits of a creativity- and goal-oriented approach to early software development.},

Feedback consisted of having Ss listen to the first third of their performance and then continue to work on the remainder. Performance under all conditions was cor- related with personality variables derived from the California Psychological Inventory (CPI), the Firo-B, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, a vocabulary test, and five factors derived from a factor analysis of the CPI. Experiment I indicated that there is no difference between a combination of group and individual brainstorming and simply individual brainstorming. Experiment II indicated that individual brainstorming is superior to group brainstorming which is superior to group critical problem solving. Feedback had no effect on performance within procedures. The CPI Sociability scale and the first factor of the CPI were shown to be consistently related to performance under group- problem-solving conditions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

We asked people with varying degrees of visualization expertise, from novices to experts, to manually sketch representations of a small, easily understandable dataset using pencils and paper and to report on what they learned or found interesting about the data. From this study, we extract a data sketching representation continuum from numeracy to abstraction; a data report spectrum from individual data items to speculative data hypothesis; and show the correspondence between the representation types and the data reports from our results set. From these observations we discuss the participants' representations in relation to their data reports, indicating implications for design and potentially fruitful directions for research.},

Explaining Creativity considers not only arts like painting and writing, but also science, stage performance, business innovation, and creativity in everyday life. Sawyer's approach is interdisciplinary. In addition to examining psychological studies on creativity, he draws on anthropologists' research on creativity in non-Western cultures, sociologists' research on the situations, contexts, and networks of creative activity, and cognitive neuroscientists' studies of the brain. He moves beyond the individual to consider the social and cultural contexts of creativity, including the role of collaboration in the creative process.},

While several researchers have addressed the difficulties of evalu- ating information visualizations with regards to changing data, tasks, and visual encodings, consid- erably less work has been published on the difficulties of evaluation within specific work contexts. We specifically focus on the challenges which arise in the context of large companies with several thousand employees. Based on our own experience from a 3.5-year collaboration within a large auto- motive company, we first present a collection of nine information visualization evaluation challenges. We then discuss these challenges by means of two concrete visualization case studies from our own work. We finally derive a set of sixteen recommendations for planning and conducting evaluations in large company settings. The set of challenges and recommendations and the discussion of our experience are meant to provide practical guidance to other researchers and practitioners who plan to study information visualization in large company settings.},

  abstract = {Most information visualisation methods are based on abstract visual representations without any concrete manifestation in the ``real world''. However, a variety of abstract datasets can indeed be related to, and hence enriched by, real-world aspects. In these cases an additional virtual representation of the 3D object can help to gain a better insight into the connection between abstract and real-world issues. We demonstrate this approach with two prototype systems that combine information visualisation with 3D models in multiple coordinated views. The first prototype involves the visualisation of in-car communication traces. The 3D model of the car serves as one view among several and provides the user with information about the car's activities. LibViz, our second prototype, is based on a full screen 3D representation of a library building. Measured data is visualised in overlaid, semi-transparent windows to allow the user interpretation of the data in its spatial context of the library's 3D model. Based on the two prototypes, we identify the benefits and drawbacks of the approach, investigate aspects of coordination between the 3D model and the abstract visualisations, and discuss principals for a general approach.},

The role of sketching in design is used to exemplify some of the complexity of designing. In conclusion, comments are made about the value and relevance of research into artificial intelligence (AI) in design.

Data physicalization - encoding data in physical artefacts - allows for new ways to represent and communicate data and, as a process, can make the principles of data representation more "graspable". In order to (1) engage different research communities to discuss data physicalization from a social and technology point of view, (2) promote data-driven prototyping, and (3) teach physicalization as a creative process in educational settings we have run hands-on data physicalization workshops within Human Computer Interaction, Information visualization and Design communities. Based on these workshops, we identified three main pitfalls that can cause participants to get stuck in the data preparation, ideation and construction phases. To address these, we designed a workshop to facilitate a rapid engagement in physicalization activities. Testing this method as part of another physicalization workshop shows its potential for participant engagement, prototyping and design reflection. Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

These large data sets present significant challenges for data storage, access, viewing, annotation and analysis. The cost and overhead of collecting and storing the data can be extremely high. Large data sets quickly exceed an individual's capability for timely analysis and present challenges in efficiently applying transforms, if needed. Finally annotated anatomical data sets can represent a significant investment of resources and should be easily accessible to the scientific community. The Viking application was our solution created to view and annotate a 16.5 TB ultrastructural retinal connectome volume and we demonstrate its utility in reconstructing neural networks for a distinctive retinal amacrine cell class. Viking has several key features. (1) It works over the internet using HTTP and supports many concurrent users limited only by hardware. (2) It supports a multi-user, collaborative annotation strategy. (3) It cleanly demarcates viewing and analysis from data collection and hosting. (4) It is capable of applying transformations in real-time. (5) It has an easily extensible user interface, allowing addition of specialized modules without rewriting the viewer.},

  abstract = {Large scale semantic graphs such as social networks and knowledge graphs contain rich and useful information. However, due to combined challenges in scale, density, and heterogeneity, it is impractical for users to answer many interesting questions by visual inspection alone. This is because even a semantically simple question, such as which of my extended friends are also fans of my favorite band, can in fact require information from a non-trivial number of nodes to answer. In this paper, we propose a method that combines graph browsing with query to overcome the limitation of visual inspection. By using query as the main way for information discovery in graph exploration, our ``query, expand, and query again'' model enables users to probe beyond the visible part of the graph and only bring in the interesting nodes, leaving the view clutter-free. We have implemented a prototype called GraphCharter and demonstrated its effectiveness and usability in a case study and a user study on Freebase knowledge graph with millions of nodes and edges.},

The widely used node-link diagrams excel at this task, but many are difficult to extract meaning from because of the inherent complexity of the relationships and limited screen space. To help address this problem we introduce a technique called motif simplification, in which common patterns of nodes and links are replaced with compact and meaningful glyphs. Well-designed glyphs have several benefits: they (1) require less screen space and layout effort, (2) are easier to understand in the context of the network, (3) can reveal otherwise hidden relationships, and (4) preserve as much underlying information as possible. We tackle three frequently occurring and high-payoff motifs: fans of nodes with a single neighbor, connectors that link a set of anchor nodes, and cliques of completely connected nodes. We contribute design guidelines for motif glyphs; example glyphs for the fan, connector, and clique motifs; algorithms for detecting these motifs; a free and open source reference implementation; and results from a controlled study of 36 participants that demonstrates the effectiveness of motif simplification.},

Therefore analysts often rely on a suite of different techniques, and visual graph analysis application builders strive to provide this breadth of techniques. To provide a holistic model for specifying network visualization techniques (as opposed to considering each technique in isolation) we present the Graph-Level Operations (GLO) model. We describe a method for identifying GLOs and apply it to identify five classes of GLOs, which can be flexibly combined to re-create six canonical graph visualization techniques. We discuss advantages of the GLO model, including potentially discovering new, effective network visualization techniques and easing the engineering challenges of building multi-technique graph visualization applications. Finally, we implement the GLOs that we identified into the GLO-STIX prototype system that enables an analyst to interactively explore a graph by applying GLOs.},

In practice, it is a catchall phrase intended to describe the many novel online sociotechnical systems that have emerged in recent years, including services like email, discussion forums, blogs, microblogs, texting, chat, social networking sites, wikis, photo and video sharing sites, review sites, and multiplayer gaming communities. Social media tools allow users to collaboratively create, find, share, evaluate, and make sense of the mass of information available online. Social media systems come in a variety of forms and support numerous genres of interaction. Key dimensions along which many social media services can be located include size of producer and consumer population, pace of interaction, genre of basic elements, control of basic elements, types of connections, and retention of content. The chapter presents a brief description of some popular types of social media, such as asynchronous threaded conversations, synchronous conversations, the World Wide Web, blogs, podcasts, social sharing sites, social networking services, online markets and production, virtual worlds, and mobile-based services.},

A core task in network analysis is to evaluate and understand group cohesion; that is, to explain why groups of elements belong together based on the underlying structure of the network. We present Detangler, a system that supports visual analysis of group cohesion in multiplex networks through dual linked views. These views feature new data abstractions derived from the original multiplex network: the substrate network and the catalyst network. We contribute two novel techniques that allow the user to analyze the complex structure of the multiplex network without the extreme visual clutter that would result from simply showing it directly. The harmonized layout visual encoding technique provides spatial stability between the substrate and catalyst views. The pivot brushing interaction technique supports linked highlighting between the views based on computations in the underlying multiplex network to leapfrog between subsets of catalysts and substrates. We present results from the motivating application domain of annotated news documents with a usage scenario and preliminary expert feedback. A second usage scenario presents group cohesion analysis of the social network of the early American independence movement},

In the context of human connectomics, such representations are not however always satisfactory because canonical methods for vertex-edge relationship representation do not always offer optimal insight regarding functional and structural neural connectivity. This article introduces an innovative framework for the depiction of human connectomics by employing a circular visualization method which is highly suitable to the exploration of central nervous system architecture. This type of representation, which we name a 'connectogram', has the capability of classifying neuroconnectivity relationships intuitively and elegantly. A multimodal protocol for MRI/DTI neuroimaging data acquisition is here combined with automatic image segmentation to (1) extract cortical and non-cortical anatomical structures, (2) calculate associated volumetrics and morphometrics, and (3) determine patient-specific connectivity profiles to generate subject-level and population-level connectograms. The scalability of our approach is demonstrated for a population of 50 adults. Two essential advantages of the connectogram are (1) the enormous potential for mapping and analyzing the human connectome, and (2) the unconstrained ability to expand and extend this analysis framework to the investigation of clinical populations and animal models. ?? 2012.},

During the development of information visualization techniques the designer has to take into account the users' tasks to choose the graphical metaphor as well as the interactive methods to be provided. Testing and evaluating the usability of information visualization techniques are still a research question, and methodologies based on real or experimental users often yield significant results. To be comprehensive, however, experiments with users must rely on a set of tasks that covers the situations a real user will face when using the visualization tool. The present work reports and discusses the results of three case studies conducted as Multi-dimensional In-depth Long-term Case studies.

It thus creates a special type of time-dependent network. Such processes are studied in various applications, for example, in financial network analysis, infection diffusion prediction, supply-chain management, or gene regulation. Visual analytics methods can help analysts examine contagion effects. For this purpose, network visualizations need to be complemented with specific features to illustrate the contagion process. Moreover, new visual analysis techniques for comparison of contagion need to be developed. In this paper, we propose a system geared to the visual analysis of contagion. It includes the simulation of contagion effects as well as their visual exploration. We present new tools able to compare the evolution of the different contagion processes. In this way, propagation of disturbances can be effectively analyzed. We focus on financial networks; however, our system can be applied to other use cases as well.},

  abstract = {While the idea that querying mechanisms for complex  relationships (otherwise known as Semantic Associations)  should be integral to Semantic Web search technologies has  recently gained some ground, the issue of how search results  will be ranked remains largely unaddressed. Since it is expected  that the number of relationships between entities in a knowledge  base will be much larger than the number of entities themselves,  the likelihood that Semantic Association searches would result  in an overwhelming number of results for users is increased,  therefore elevating the need for appropriate ranking schemes.  Furthermore, it is unlikely that ranking schemes for ranking  entities (documents, resources, etc.) may be applied to complex  structures such as Semantic Associations.     In this paper, we present an approach that ranks results based on  how predictable a result might be for users. It is based on a  relevance model SemRank, which is a rich blend of semantic  and information-theoretic techniques with heuristics that  supports the novel idea of modulative searches, where users may  vary their search modes to effect changes in the ordering of  results depending on their need. We also present the  infrastructure used in the SSARK system to support the  computation of SemRank values for resulting Semantic  Associations and their ordering.},

  abstract = {Design studies are an increasingly popular form of problem-driven visualization research, yet there is little guidance available about how to do them effectively. In this paper we reflect on our combined experience of conducting twenty-one design studies, as well as reading and reviewing many more, and on an extensive literature review of other field work methods and methodologies. Based on this foundation we provide definitions, propose a methodological framework, and provide practical guidance for conducting design studies. We define a design study as a project in which visualization researchers analyze a specific real-world problem faced by domain experts, design a visualization system that supports solving this problem, validate the design, and reflect about lessons learned in order to refine visualization design guidelines. We characterize two axes - a task clarity axis from fuzzy to crisp and an information location axis from the domain expert's head to the computer - and use these axes to reason about design study contributions, their suitability, and uniqueness from other approaches. The proposed methodological framework consists of 9 stages: learn, winnow, cast, discover, design, implement, deploy, reflect, and write. For each stage we provide practical guidance and outline potential pitfalls. We also conducted an extensive literature survey of related methodological approaches that involve a significant amount of qualitative field work, and compare design study methodology to that of ethnography, grounded theory, and action research.},

  abstract = {During animal development, complex patterns of gene expression provide positional information within the embryo. To better understand the underlying gene regulatory networks, the Berkeley Drosophila Transcription Network Project (BDTNP) has developed methods that support quantitative computational analysis of three-dimensional (3D) gene expression in early Drosophila embryos at cellular resolution. We introduce PointCloudXplore (PCX), an interactive visualization tool that supports visual exploration of relationships between different genes' expression using a combination of established visualization techniques. Two aspects of gene expression are of particular interest: 1) gene expression patterns defined by the spatial locations of cells expressing a gene and 2) relationships between the expression levels of multiple genes. PCX provides users with two corresponding classes of data views: 1) Physical Views based on the spatial relationships of cells in the embryo and 2) Abstract Views that discard spatial information and plot expression levels of multiple genes with respect to each other. Cell Selectors highlight data associated with subsets of embryo cells within a View. Using linking, these selected cells can be viewed in multiple representations. We describe PCX as a 3D gene expression visualization tool and provide examples of how it has been used by BDTNP biologists to generate new hypotheses.},

Overplotting hides the true number of points that are displayed, and showing point clouds in 3D is problematic both in terms of perception and interaction. We propose a combination of 2D and 3D scatterplots, together with some extensions to overcome these problems. By linking 2D and 3D views, it is possible to interact in 2D and get feedback in 3D. That feedback is also enhanced by depth cues (color and point size) such that the user gets a better depth impression. Histograms in 2D and 3D show additional information about point densities and additional context can be displayed. An example application demonstrates the usefulness of the technique.},

  abstract = {There is increasing evidence that user characteristics can have a significant impact on visualization effectiveness, suggesting that visualizations could be designed to better fit each user's specific needs. Most studies to date, how- ever, have looked at static visualizations. Studies considering interactive visualizations have only looked at a li- mited number of user characteristics, and consider either low-level tasks (e.g., value retrieval), or high-level tasks (in particular: discovery), but not both. This paper contributes to this line of work by looking at the impact of a large set of user characteristics on user performance with interactive visualizations, for both low and high-level tasks. We focus on interactive visualizations that support decision making, exemplified by a visualization known as Value Charts. We include in the study two versions of ValueCharts that differ in terms of layout, to ascertain whether layout mediates the impact of individual differences and could be considered as a form of personalization. Our key findings are that (i) performance with low and high-level tasks is affected by different user characteristics, and (ii) users with low visual working memory perform better with a horizontal layout. We discuss how these find- ings can inform the provision of personalized support to visualization processing. Categories},

Synchronized visual highlighting of related elements is a well-known technique used to assist this task. An alternative approach, which is more invasive but also more expressive is visual linking in which line connections are rendered between related elements. In this work, we present context-preserving visual links as a new method for generating visual links. The method specifically aims to fulfill the following two goals: first, visual links should minimize the occlusion of important information; second, links should visually stand out from surrounding information by minimizing visual interference. We employ an image-based analysis of visual saliency to determine the important regions in the original representation. A consequence of the image-based approach is that our technique is application-independent and can be employed in a large number of visual data analysis scenarios in which the underlying content cannot or should not be altered. We conducted a controlled experiment that indicates that users can find linked elements in complex visualizations more quickly and with greater subjective satisfaction than in complex visualizations in which plain highlighting is used. Context-preserving visual links were perceived as visually more attractive than traditional visual links that do not account for the context information.},

We describe the role visualization of these data played in fostering engagement with policy makers, transport operators, the transport research community, the museum and gallery sector and the general public. We identify each of these as `channels' \textendash{} evolving relationships between producers and consumers of visualization \textendash{} where traditional roles of the visualization expert and domain expert are blurred. In each case, we identify the different design decisions that were required to support each of these channels and the role played by the visualization process. Using chauffeured interaction with a flexible visual analytics system we demonstrate how insight was gained by policy makers into gendered spatio-temporal cycle behaviors, how this led to further insight into workplace commuting activity, group cycling behavior and explanations for street navigation choice. We demonstrate how this supported, and was supported by, the seemingly unrelated development of narrative-driven visualization via TEDx, of the creation and the setting of an art installation and the curating of digital and physical artefacts. We assert that existing models of visualization design, of tool/technique development and of insight generation do not adequately capture the richness of parallel engagement via these multiple channels of communication. We argue that developing multiple channels in parallel opens up opportunities for visualization design and analysis by building trust and authority and supporting creativity. This rich, non-sequential approach to visualization design is likely to foster serendipity, deepen insight and increase impact.},

Users can create different types of coordinations such as: brushing, drill down, overview and detail view, and synchronized scrolling. Visualization developers can make their independent visualizations snap-able with a simple API. Evaluation of Snap revealed benefits, cognitive issues, and usability concerns.

  abstract = {In this paper we present an algorithm for low-cost hardware antialiasing and transparency. This technique keeps a central Z value along with compact floating-point Z gradients in the X and Y dimensions for each fragment within a pixel (hence the name Z3). It uses a small fixed amount of storage per pixel. If the visible complexity of the pixel exceeds the storage space available for the pixel, the minimum number of fragments having the closest Z values are merged. This combines different fragments from the same surface, resulting in both storage and processing efficiency. When operating with opaque surfaces, Z3 can provide superior image quality over sparse supersampling methods that use eight samples per pixel while using storage for only three fragments. Z3 also makes the use of large numbers of samples (e.g., 16) feasible in inexpensive hardware, enabling higher quality images. It is simple to implement because it uses a small fixed number of fragments per pixel. Z3 can also provide order-independent transparency even if many transparent surfaces are present. Moreover, unlike the original A-buffer algorithm it correctly antialiases interpenetrating transparent surfaces because it has three-dimensional Z information within each pixel.},

  volume = {2},
  abstract = {Forward rendering pipelines shade fragments in triangle-submission order. Consequently, non-visible fragments are often wastefully shaded before being subsequently occluded--a phenomenon known as over-shading. A popular way to avoid over-shading is to only compute surface attributes for each fragment during a forward pass and store them in a buffer. Lighting is performed in a subsequent pass, consuming the attributes buffer. This strategy is commonly known as deferred shading. We identify two notable deficits. First, the buffer for the geometric surface attributes (g-buffer) is large, often 20+ bytes per visibility sample. The bandwidth required to read and write large g-buffers can be prohibitive on mobile or integrated GPUs. Second, the separation of shading work and visibility is incomplete. Surface attributes are eagerly computed in the forward pass on occluded fragments, wasting texture bandwidth and compute resources. To address these problems, we propose to replace the g-buffer with a simple visibility buffer that only stores a triangle index and instance ID per sample, encoded in as few as four bytes. This significantly reduces storage and bandwidth requirements. Generating a visibility buffer is cheaper than generating a g-buffer and does not require texture reads or any surface-material-specific computation. The deferred shading pass accesses triangle data with this index to compute barycentric coordinates and interpolated vertex data. By minimizing the memory footprint of the visibility solution, we reduce the working set of the deferred rendering pipeline. This results in improved performance on bandwidth-limited GPU platforms, especially for high-resolution workloads.},

This enables caching and efficient reuse of shading computation, e.g. for stochastic rasterization techniques. In contrast to previous methods, our decoupled shading can be efficiently implemented on current graphics hardware. We describe two variants which differ in the way the shading samples are cached: the first maintains a single cache for the entire image in global memory, while the second pursues a tile-based approach leveraging local memory of the GPU's multiprocessors. We demonstrate the application of decoupled deferred shading to speed up the rendering in applications with stochastic supersampling, depth of field, and motion blur.},

  abstract = {Post-processing antialiasing methods are well suited for deferred shading because they decouple antialiasing from the rest of graphics pipeline. In morphological methods, the final image is filtered with a data-dependent filter. The filter coefficients are computed by analyzing the non-local neighborhood of each pixel. Though very simple and efficient, such methods have intrinsic quality limitations due to spatial undersampling and temporal aliasing. We explore an alternative formulation in which filter coefficients are computed locally for each pixel by supersampling geometry, while shading is still done only once per pixel. During pre-processing, each geometric subsample is converted to a single bit indicating whether the subsample is different from the central one. The ensuing binary mask is then used in the post-processing step to retrieve filter coefficients, which were precomputed for all possible masks. For a typical 8 subsamples, it results in a sub-millisecond performance, while improving the image quality by about 10 dB. To compare subsamples, we use a novel symmetric angular measure, which has a simple geometric interpretation. We propose to use this measure in a variety of applications that assess the difference between geometric samples (rendering, mesh simplification, geometry encoding, adaptive tessellation)},

It works by introducing the concept of a new sample type: a sample that represents coverage. This differs from previous AA techniques where coverage was always inherently tied to another sample type. In supersampling for example, each sample represents shaded color, stored color/z/stencil, and coverage, which essentially amounts to rendering to an oversized buffer and downfiltering. MSAA reduces the shader overhead of this operation by decoupling shaded samples from stored color and coverage; this allows applications using antialiasing to operate with fewer shaded samples while maintaining the same quality color/z/stencil and coverage sampling. CSAA further optimizes this process by decoupling coverage from color/z/stencil, thus reducing bandwidth and storage costs.},

Exploiting the fact that the human visual system is more sensitive to fine spatial variations of luminance than of chrominance, the rasterizer generates fragments in the YCoCg color space and directly stores the chrominance channels at a lower resolution using a mosaic pattern. When reading from the buffer, a simple and efficient edge-directed reconstruction filter provides a very precise estimation of the original uncompressed values. We demonstrate that the quality loss from our method is negligible, while the bandwidth reduction results in a sizable increase in the fill rate of the GPU rasterizer.},

We find that a fragment-shading pipeline with this optimization is competitive with the REYES pipeline approach of shading at micropolygon vertices and, in cases of complex occlusion, can perform up to two times less shading work.},

One is a new method for linearizing metabolic pathways that provides appropriate topological information and supports the comparison of quantitative data along the pathway. The second is the curvemap view, a depiction of time series data for comparison of gene activity and metabolite levels across multiple species. Pathline was developed in close collaboration with a team of genomic scientists.

While work in this area has relied on either manually recorded provenance (e.g., user notes) or automat- ically recorded event-based insight provenance (e.g., clicks, drags, and key-presses), both approaches have fundamental limitations. Our aim is to develop a new approach that combines the benefits of both approaches while avoiding their deficiencies. Toward this goal, we characterize users' visual analytic activity at multiple lev- els of granularity. Moreover, we identify a critical level of abstrac- tion, Actions, that can be used to represent visual analytic activity with a set of general but semantically meaningful behavior types. In turn, the action types can be used as the semantic building blocks for insight provenance. We present a catalog of common actions identified through observations of several different visual analytic systems. In addition, we define a taxonomy to categorize actions into three major classes based on their semantic intent. The con- cept of actions has been integrated into our lab's prototype visual analytic system, HARVEST, as the basis for its insight provenance capabilities. Keywords:},

Our implementation also detects axis-orthogonal triangles and processing them separately. For maximum performance we also introduce a method for triangle representation, using only necessary pre-computed values.

  abstract = {I tested mailboxing within the GOLEM project, I can switch it on and off by recompiling the source codes using macros for conditional compilation as \#ifdef ... My experience is that for the primitives in GOLEM the use of mailboxing improves the time required by at most 5-6\%, but it can also increase the time by the same amount. This is heavily dependent on the surfaces, scene geometry and camera setting used. For triangles, spheres, cones, cylinders and other simpler primitives (as used within GOLEM) together with a good ray shooting algorithm, the use of mailboxing does not make sense or is completely questionable. For objects, where the ray-object intersection is computationally demanding (as NURBS and other spline, algebraic surfaces) it probably makes sense in most cases. The worse the ray shooting algorithm, the higher probability of testing unsuccessfully the same objects, and then logically mailboxing will be more successful. What would be a possible topic for research: given some ray shooting algorithm and the scene, predict whether the use of mailboxing makes sense or not. But the improvements in the time can be not so surprising. Since mailboxing also causes problems when uses in a parallel environment and particularly requires writing the results in the first access to the object into the main memory, my current feeling and all previous experience is then "no mailboxes," or use them only for some class of complex objects.},

In this paper, we propose a novel interactive visualization paradigm for exploring and comparing multiple sets of time series data. In particular, we propose a focus+context approach, where a "focus" segment of a time series is zoomed into and visualized using a linear layout at one scale, while the remaining segments of the time series (i.e., the context) are visualized using spiral data layouts. Our paradigm allows the user to dynamically select and compare different sections of each time series independently, facilitating the exploration of time series data in a fun and engaging way.},

Our design space consists of five design dimensions that characterize the main aspects of tasks and that have so far been distributed across different task descriptions. We exemplify its concrete use by applying our design space in the domain of climate impact research.

The metric is based on a rendering-by-components framework in which the direct, and indirect diffuse, glossy, and specular light transport paths are separately computed and then composited to produce an image. The metric predicts the perceptual importances of the computationally expensive indirect illumination components with respect to image quality. To develop the metric we conducted a series of psychophysical experiments in which we measured and modeled the perceptual importances of the components. An important property of this new metric is that it predicts component importances from inexpensive estimates of the reflectance properties of a scene, and therefore adds negligible overhead to the rendering process. This perceptual metric should enable the development of an important new class of efficient global-illumination rendering systems that can intelligently allocate limited computational resources, to provide high quality images at interactive rates.},

The features of our system allow users to nd appropriate parameter settings for data mining algorithms through lightweight visual experimentation showing partial results. We use dynamic constrained frequent set mining as a concrete case study to showcase the utility of the system. The key challenge for spatial layouts based on power set structure is handling large alphabets, because the size of the power set grows exponentially with the size of the alphabet.

Two problems are raised by this goal: The codification of graphic design criteria in a form that can be used by the presentation tool, and the generation of a wide variety of designs so that the presentation tool can accommodate a wide variety of information. The approach described in this paper is based on the view that graphical presentations are sentences of graphical languages. The graphic design issues are codified as expressiveness and effectiveness criteria for graphical languages. Expressiveness criteria determine whether a graphical language can express the desired information. Effectiveness criteria determine whether a graphical language exploits the capabilities of the output medium and the human visual system. A wide variety of designs can be systematically generated by using a composition algebra that composes a small set of primitive graphical languages. Artificial intelligence techniques are used to implement a prototype presentation tool called APT (A Presentation Tool), which is based on the composition algebra and the graphic design criteria.},

Water is complex and recognizable, and continues to be in the forefront of research. However, the contribution of individual lighting phenomena to the perceived realism of virtual water has not been addressed. All these phenomena have costs associated with their rendering, but does the visual benefit outweigh these costs? This study investigates the human perception of various illumination components found in water-rich virtual environments. The investigation uses a traditional psychophysical analysis to examine viewer perception of these lighting phenomena as they relate to the rendering cost, and ultimately reveals common trends in perceptual value. Five different scenes with a wide range of water and lighting dynamics were tested for perceptual value by one hundred participants. Our results provide an importance comparison for lighting phenomena in the rendering of water, and cost reductions can be made with little or no effect on the perceived quality of the imagery if viewed in a scenario similar to our testing.},

Based on this additional information, different set relationships may exist among people. Revealing the set relationships in a network can help people gain social insight and better understand their roles within a community. In this paper, we present a visualization system for exploring set relations in a graph. Our system is de- signed to reveal three different relationships simultaneously: the social relationship of people, the set relationship among people's items of interest, and the similarity relationship of the items. We propose two novel visualization designs: a) a glyph-based visualization to reveal people's set relationships in the context of their social networks; b) an integration of visual links and a contour map to show people and their items of interest which are clustered into different groups.

Participants saw a display of eight natural objects arranged in a circle and used a partial report procedure to assign one object to the position it previously occupied during stimulus presentation. At the longest viewing time of 7,000 ms or 10 fixations, memory performance was significantly higher than at the shorter times. This increase was accompanied by a primacy effect, suggesting a contribution of another memory component-for example, visual long-term memory (VLTM). We found a very limited beneficial effect of fixations on objects; fixated objects were only remembered better at the shortest viewing times. Our results revealed an intriguing difference between the use of a blocked versus an interleaved experimental design. When trial length was predictable, in the blocked design, target fixation durations increased with longer viewing times. When trial length was unpredictable, fixation durations stayed the same for all viewing lengths. Memory performance was not affected by this design manipulation, thus also supporting the idea that the number and duration of fixations are not closely coupled to memory performance.},

  abstract = {Observers can store thousands of object images in visual long-term memory with high fidelity, but the fidelity of scene representations in long-term memory is not known. Here, we probed scene-representation fidelity by varying the number of studied exemplars in different scene categories and testing memory using exemplar-level foils. Observers viewed thousands of scenes over 5.5 hr and then completed a series of forced-choice tests. Memory performance was high, even with up to 64 scenes from the same category in memory. Moreover, there was only a 2\% decrease in accuracy for each doubling of the number of studied scene exemplars. Surprisingly, this degree of categorical interference was similar to the degree previously demonstrated for object memory. Thus, although scenes have often been defined as a superset of objects, our results suggest that scenes and objects may be entities at a similar level of abstraction in visual long-term memory.},

However, the indirect illumination we perceive on a daily basis is rarely of high frequency nature, as the most significant aspect of light transport in real-world scenes is diffuse, and thus displays a smooth gradation. This raises the question of whether accurate visibility is perceptually necessary in this case. To answer this question, we conduct a psychophysical study on the perceptual influence of approximate visibility on indirect illumination. This study reveals that accurate visibility is not required and that certain approximations may be introduced.},

  abstract = {Caustic maps provide an interactive image-space method to render caustics, the focusing of light via reflection and refraction. Unfortunately, caustic mapping suffers problems similar to shadow mapping: aliasing from poor sampling and map projection as well as temporal incoherency from frame-to-frame sampling variations. To reduce these problems, researchers have suggested methods ranging from caustic blurring to building a multiresolution caustic map. Yet these all require a fixed photon sampling, precluding the use of importance-based photon densities. This paper introduces adaptive caustic maps. Instead of densely sampling photons via a rasterization pass, we adaptively emit photons using a deferred shading pass. We describe deferred rendering for refractive surfaces, which speeds rendering of refractive geometry up to 25\% and with adaptive sampling speeds caustic rendering up to 200\%. These benefits are particularly noticable for complex geometry or using millions of photons. While developed for a GPU rasterizer, adaptive caustic map creation can be performed by any renderer that individually traces photons, e.g., a GPU ray tracer.},

  abstract = {Cells in an organism share the same genetic information in their DNA, but have very different forms and behavior because of the selective expression of subsets of their genes. The widely used approach of measuring gene expression over time from a tissue sample using techniques such as microarrays or sequencing do not provide information about the spatial position within the tissue where these genes are expressed. In contrast, we are working with biologists who use techniques that measure gene expression in every individual cell of entire fruitfly embryos over an hour of their development, and do so for multiple closely-related subspecies of Drosophila. These scientists are faced with the challenge of integrating temporal gene expression data with the spatial location of cells and, moreover, comparing this data across multiple related species. We have worked with these biologists over the past two years to develop MulteeSum, a visualization system that supports inspection and curation of data sets showing gene expression over time, in conjunction with the spatial location of the cells where the genes are expressed--it is the first tool to support comparisons across multiple such data sets. MulteeSum is part of a general and flexible framework we developed with our collaborators that is built around multiple summaries for each cell, allowing the biologists to explore the results of computations that mix spatial information, gene expression measurements over time, and data from multiple related species or organisms. We justify our design decisions based on specific descriptions of the analysis needs of our collaborators, and provide anecdotal evidence of the efficacy of MulteeSum through a series of case studies.},

To explain the tension and to lay a foundation for new ways to structure software development.

The result is a development process in which external design is separated from internal design and construction. The external design work consists of concep- tual, constitutive and consolidatory steps.

The use of lofidelity prototyping, especially paper-based sketching, can save time, money and converge to better solutions more quickly.

We present the Five Design Sheet (FdS) methodology. The methodology enables users to create information visualization interfaces through lo-fidelity methods. Users sketch and plan their ideas, helping them express different possibilities, think through these ideas to consider their potential effectiveness as solutions to the task (sheet 1); they create three principle designs (sheets 2,3 and 4); before converging on a final realization design that can then be implemented (sheet 5). In this article, we present (i) a review of the use of sketching as a planning method for visualization and the benefits of sketching, (ii) a detailed description of the Five Design Sheet (FdS) methodology, and (iii) an evaluation of the FdS using the System Usability Scale, along with a case-study of its use in industry and experience of its use in teaching.},

  abstract = {In this position paper we discuss successes and limitations of current evaluation strategies for scientific visualizations and argue for embracing a mixed methods strategy of evaluation. The most novel contribution of the approach that we advocate is a new emphasis on employing design processes as practiced in related fields (e.g., graphic design, illustration, architecture) as a formalized mode of evaluation for data visualizations. To motivate this position we describe a series of recent evaluations of scientific visualization interfaces and computer graphics strategies conducted within our research group. Complementing these more traditional evaluations our visualization research group also regularly employs sketching, critique, and other design methods that have been formalized over years of practice in design fields. Our experience has convinced us that these activities are invaluable, often providing much more detailed evaluative feedback about our visualization systems than that obtained via more traditional user studies and the like. We believe that if design-based evaluation methodologies (e.g., ideation, sketching, critique) can be taught and embraced within the visualization community then these may become one of the most effective future strategies for both formative and summative evaluations.},

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. The basis of cross-suppression between rod and cone channels has long been an enigma. Using rabbit retinal connectome RC1, we show that all cone bipolar cell (BC) classes inhibit rod BCs via amacrine cell (AC) motifs (C1-6); that all cone BC classes are themselves inhibited by AC motifs (R1-5, R25) driven by rod BCs. A sparse symmetric AC motif (CR) is presynaptic and postsynaptic to both rod and cone BCs. ON cone BCs of all classes drive inhibition of rod BCs via motif C1 wide-field GABAergic ACs ($\gamma$ACs) and motif C2 narrow field glycinergic ON ACs (GACs). Each rod BC receives $\approx$10 crossover AC synapses and each ON cone BC can target $\approx$10 or more rod BCs via separate AC processes. OFF cone BCs mediate monosynaptic inhibition of rod BCs via motif C3 driven by OFF $\gamma$ACs and GACs and disynaptic inhibition via motifs C4 and C5 driven by OFF wide-field $\gamma$ACs and narrow-field GACs, respectively. Motifs C4 and C5 form halos of 60-100 inhibitory synapses on proximal dendrites of AI $\gamma$ACs. Rod BCs inhibit surrounding arrays of cone BCs through AII GAC networks that access ON and OFF cone BC patches via motifs R1, R2, R4, R5 and a unique ON AC motif R3 that collects rod BC inputs and targets ON cone BCs. Crossover synapses for motifs C1, C4, C5, and R3 are 3-4\texttimes{} larger than typical feedback synapses, which may be a signature for synaptic winner-take-all switches.},

  abstract = {IEEE We investigate whether the notion of active reading for text might be usefully applied to visualizations. Through a qualitative study we explored whether people apply observable active reading techniques when reading paper-based node-link visualizations. Participants used a range of physical actions while reading, and from these we synthesized an initial set of active reading techniques for visualizations. To learn more about the potential impact such techniques may have on visualization reading, we implemented support for one type of physical action from our observations (making freeform marks) in an interactive node-link visualization. Results from our quantitative study of this implementation show that interactive support for active reading techniques can improve the accuracy of performing low-level visualization tasks. Together, our studies suggest that the active reading space is ripe for research exploration within visualization and can lead to new interactions that make for a more flexible and effective visualization reading experience.},

In this article we argue, however, that designing information visualization techniques often requires more than designing for user requirements. Additionally, the data that are to be visualized must also be carefully considered. An approach based on both the user and their data is encapsulated by two questions, which we argue information visualization designers should continually ask themselves: ‘What does the user want to see?' and ‘What do the data want to be?' As we show by presenting cases, these two points of departure are mutually reinforcing. By focusing on the data, new insight is gained into the requirements of the user, and vice versa, resulting in more effective visualization techniques.},

  abstract = {Storyboarding is a common technique in HCI and design for demonstrating system interfaces and contexts of use. Despite its recognized benefits, novice designers still encounter challenges in the creation of storyboards. Furthermore, as computing becomes increasingly integrated into the environment, blurring the distinction between the system and its surrounding context, it is imperative to depict context explicitly in storyboards. In this paper, we present two formative studies designed to uncover the important elements of storyboards. These elements include the use of text, inclusion of people, level of detail, number of panels, and representation of the passage of time. We further present an empirical study to assess the effects of these elements on the understanding and enjoyment of storyboard consumers. Finally, we demonstrate how these guidelines were successfully used in an undergraduate HCI class.},

Here we focus on pseudo-profound bullshit, which consists of seemingly impressive assertions that are presented as true and meaningful but are actually vacuous. We presented participants with bullshit statements consisting of buzzwords randomly organized into statements with syntactic structure but no discernible meaning (e.g., ``Wholeness quiets infinite phenomena''). Across multiple studies, the propensity to judge bull- shit statements as profound was associated with a variety of conceptually relevant variables (e.g., intuitive cognitive style, supernatural belief). Parallel associations were less evident among profundity judgments for more conventionally profound (e.g., ``A wet person does not fear the rain'') ormundane (e.g., ``Newborn babies require constant attention'') statements. These results support the idea that some people are more receptive to this type of bullshit and that detecting it is not merely a matter of indiscriminate skepticismbut rather a discernment of deceptive vagueness in otherwise impressive sounding claims. Our re- sults also suggest that a bias toward accepting statements as true may be an important component of pseudo-profound bullshit receptivity.},

The true value of computation to close reading is still very much an open question. During a two-year design study, we explored this question with several poetry scholars, focusing on an investigation of sound and linguistic devices in poetry. The contributions of our design study include a problem characterization and data abstraction of the use of sound in poetry as well as Poemage, a visualization tool for interactively exploring the sonic topology of a poem. The design of Poemage is grounded in the evaluation of a series of technology probes we deployed to our poetry collaborators, and we validate the final design with several case studies that illustrate the disruptive impact technology can have on poetry scholarship. Finally, we also contribute a reflection on the challenges we faced conducting visualization research in literary studies.},

It appeared that inspiration could strike anytime, particularly after an individual had worked hard on a problem for days and then turned attention to another activity. In exploring this phenomenon, Hadamard produced one of the most famous and cogent cases for the existence of unconscious mental processes in mathematical invention and other forms of creativity. Written before the explosion of research in computers and cognitive science, his book, originally titled The Psychology of Invention in the Mathematical Field, remains an important tool for exploring the increasingly complex problem of mental life. The roots of creativity for Hadamard lie not in consciousness, but in the long unconscious work of incubation, and in the unconscious aesthetic selection of ideas that thereby pass into consciousness. His discussion of this process comprises a wide range of topics, including the use of mental images or symbols, visualized or auditory words, "meaningless" words, logic, and intuition. Among the important documents collected is a letter from Albert Einstein analyzing his own mechanism of thought.},

We propose an action framework for the analysis of creative acts built on the assumption that creativity is a relational, inter-subjective phenomenon. This framework, drawing extensively from the work of Dewey (1934) on art as experience, is used to derive a coding frame for the analysis of interview material. The article reports findings from the analysis of 60 interviews with recognized French creators in five creative domains: art, design, science, scriptwriting, and music. Results point to complex models of action and inter-action specific for each domain and also to interesting patterns of similarity and differences between domains. These findings highlight the fact that creative action takes place not "inside" individual creators but "in between" actors and their environment.

  abstract = {The subject of creativity is a neglected area in the literature of the information systems field. Yet, according to a Delphi survey of chief information officers, the field needs to be developing more creative and innovative solutions to its problems. Organizations must first be sure that certain preconditions and organizational components be in place to help individuals and teams become more creative. They can then use numerous creativity improvements techniques that have proved successful in other disciplines. In this article, six case studies show how analytical techniques (progressive abstraction, interrogatories. and force field analysis) and Intuitive techniques (associations/images, wishful thinking, and analogy/metaphor) have been used in several industries to solve a variety of IS-related problems and/or opportunities. All told, some 20 creativity techniques prove especially appropriate for the IS field. Once managers understand when and where to use creativity techniques, they can move forward with implementing formal creativity improvement programs in their organizations. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

We used qualitative fieldwork and participatory design to investigate how EHRs could be designed to meet these needs. The contributions of this work are twofold: we identified and described the informal processes of documentation and communication that we refer to as collaborative reflection, and then developed design recommendations for EHRs to support these existing workflows. We studied treatment teams providing behavioral and mental health services as part of integrated school programs for children with special needs. To make ongoing treatment decisions, team members document progress daily and communicate frequently with one another. Based on our fieldwork findings, we describe this process of collaborative reflection as (1) unstructured, (2) mobile, (3) reciprocally interdependent, and (4) long-term. We engaged the treatment teams in a participatory design process to understand how EHRs could be designed to fit this process, culminating in seven design recommendations. Our work suggests that by supporting the process of collaborative reflection, EHR-related information technology could significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of treatment teams.},

  abstract = {In today's innovation-driven economy, understanding how to generate great ideas has become an urgent managerial priority. Suddenly, the spotlight has turned on the academics who've studied creativity for decades. How relevant is their research to the practical challenges leaders face? To connect theory and practice, Harvard Business School professors Amabile and Khaire convened a two-day colloquium of leading creativity scholars and executives from companies such as Google, IDEO, Novartis, Intuit, and E Ink. In this article, the authors present highlights of the research presented and the discussion of its implications. At the event, a new leadership agenda began to take shape, one rooted in the awareness that you can't manage creativity -- you can only manage for creativity. A number of themes emerged: The leader's job is not to be the source of ideas but to encourage and champion ideas. Leaders must tap the imagination of employees at all ranks and ask inspiring questions. They also need to help their organizations incorporate diverse perspectives, which spur creative insights, and facilitate creative collaboration by, for instance, harnessing new technologies. The participants shared tactics for enabling discoveries, as well as thoughts on how to bring process to bear on creativity without straitjacketing it. They pointed out that process management isn't appropriate in all stages of creative work; leaders should apply it thoughtfully and manage the handoff from idea generators to commercializers deftly. The discussion also examined the need to clear paths through bureaucracy, weed out weak ideas, and maximize the organization's learning from failure. Though points of view varied, the theories and frameworks explored advance the understanding of creativity in business and offer executives a playbook for increasing innovation.

Here, we introduce GeoVISTA CrimeViz, a web-based map application that supports spatiotemporal exploration and sensemaking of criminal activity. The GeoVISTA CrimeViz concept provides understaffed departments with an extensible, easy-to-use tool for conducting spatiotemporal crime analysis and mapping. We are currently in the process of completing a user-centered approach to ensure that the tool 'works' for its intended audience; a description of this approach and work in progress is provided in the following subsections.},

Previous work has found that the distinctiveness of a face influences its memorability--the degree to which face images are remembered or forgotten. Here, we generalize the concept of face memorability in a large-scale memory study. First, we find that memorability is an intrinsic feature of a face photograph--across observers some faces are consistently more remembered or forgotten than others--indicating that memorability can be used for measuring, predicting, and manipulating subsequent memories. Second, we determine the role that 20 personality, social, and memory-related traits play in face memorability. Whereas we find that certain traits (such as kindness, atypicality, and trustworthiness) contribute to face memorability, they do not suffice to explain the variance in memorability scores, even when accounting for noise and differences in subjective experience. This suggests that memorability itself is a consistent, singular measure of a face that cannot be reduced to a simple combination of personality and social facial attributes. We outline modern neuroscience questions that can be explored through the lens of memorability.},

  doi = {10.1126/sciadv.1600028},
  abstract = {To ensure the correctness of network analysis methods, the network (as the input) has to be a sufficiently accurate representation of the underlying data. However, when representing sequential data from complex systems such as global shipping traffic or web clickstream traffic as networks, the conventional network representation implicitly assuming the Markov property (first-order dependency) can quickly become limiting. That is, when movements are simulated on the network, the next movement depends only on the current node, failing to capture the fact that the movement may depend on multiple previous steps. We show that data derived from some complex systems show up to fifth-order dependencies, such that the oversimplification in the first-order network representation can later result in inaccurate network analysis results. To that end, we propose the Higher-Order Network (HON) representation that can discover and embed variable orders of dependencies in a network representation. Through a comprehensive empirical evaluation and analysis, we establish several desirable characteristics of HON -- accuracy, scalability, and direct compatibility with the existing suite of network analysis methods. We illustrate the broad applicability of HON by using it as the input to a variety of tasks, such as random walking, clustering and ranking, where these methods yield more accurate results without modification. Our approach brings the representative power of networks for handling the increasingly complex systems.},

Since the late 1980s, our field has spent much effort on developing new methods to help users obtain insight, and we have made a lot of progress. Many researchers nowadays use visualization routinely to understand the results of their measurements and simulations. However, many problems still exist, and not every method reaches its intended audience. In recent years, discussion has focused on the position of our field and which goals to pursue.

  abstract = {Unlike the conventional first-order network (FoN), the higher-order network (HoN) provides a more accurate description of transitions by creating additional nodes to encode higher-order dependencies. However, there exists no visualization and exploration tool for the HoN. For applications such as the development of strategies to control species invasion through global shipping which is known to exhibit higher-order dependencies, the existing FoN visualization tools are limited. In this paper, we present HoNVis, a novel visual analytics framework for exploring higher-order dependencies of the global ocean shipping network. Our framework leverages coordinated multiple views to reveal the network structure at three levels of detail (i.e., the global, local, and individual port levels). Users can quickly identify ports of interest at the global level and specify a port to investigate its higher-order nodes at the individual port level. Investigating a larger-scale impact is enabled through the exploration of HoN at the local level. Using the global ocean shipping network data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with a real-world use case conducted by domain experts specializing in species invasion. Finally, we discuss the generalizability of this framework to other real-world applications such as information diffusion in social networks and epidemic spreading through air transportation.},

  doi = {10.1016/S0954-1810(01)00023-1},
  abstract = {This paper presents results of an ongoing interdisciplinary study to develop a computational theory of creativity for engineering design. Human design activities are surveyed, and popular computer-aided design methodologies are examined. It is argued that semiotics has the potential to merge and unite various design approaches into one fundamental theory that is naturally interpretable and so comprehensible in terms of computer use. Reviewing related work in philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science provides a general and encompassing vision of the creativity phenomenon. Basic notions of algebraic semiotics are given and explained in terms of design. This is to define a model of the design creative process, which is seen as a process of semiosis, where concepts and their attributes represented as signs organized into systems are evolved, blended, and analyzed, resulting in the development of new concepts. The model allows us to formally describe and investigate essential properties of the design process, namely its dynamics and non-determinism inherent in creative thinking. A stable pattern of creative thought - analogical and metaphorical reasoning - is specified to demonstrate the expressive power of the modeling approach; illustrative examples are given. The developed theory is applied to clarify the nature of emergence in design: it is shown that while emergent properties of a product may influence its creative value, emergence can simply be seen as a by-product of the creative process. Concluding remarks summarize the research, point to some unresolved issues, and outline directions for future work. \textcopyright{} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

However, there are many situations where such an overview is not relevant or practical for users, as analyzing the global structure may not be related to the main task of the users that have semi-specific information needs. Furthermore, users accessing large graph databases through an online connection or users running on less powerful (mobile) hardware simply do not have the resources needed to compute these overviews. In this paper, we advocate an interaction model that allows users to remotely browse the immediate context graph around a specific node of interest. We show how Furnas' original degree of interest function can be adapted from trees to graphs and how we can use this metric to extract useful contextual subgraphs, control the complexity of the generated visualization and direct users to interesting datapoints in the context. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with an exploration of a dense online database containing over 3 million legal citations.},

In this work, we present a characterization of the problems and data associated with meteorological forecasting, we propose a set of informed default encoding choices that integrate existing meteorological conventions with effective visualization practice, and we extend a set of techniques as an initial step toward directly visualizing the interactions of multiple features over an ensemble forecast.

  abstract = {We propose a new adaptive rendering algorithm that enhances the performance of Monte Carlo ray tracing by reducing the noise, i.e., variance, while preserving a variety of high-frequency edges in ren- dered images through a novel prediction based reconstruction. To achieve our goal, we iteratively build multiple, but sparse linear models. Each linear model has its prediction window, where the linear model predicts the unknown ground truth image that can be generated with an infinite number of samples. Our method recur- sively estimates prediction errors introduced by linear predictions performed with different prediction windows, and selects an opti- mal prediction window minimizing the error for each linear model. Since each linear model predicts multiple pixels within its optimal prediction interval, we can construct our linear models only at a sparse set of pixels in the image screen. Predicting multiple pixels with a single linear model poses technical challenges, related to de- riving error analysis for regions rather than pixels, and has not been addressed in the field. We address these technical challenges, and our method with robust error analysis leads to a drastically reduced reconstruction time even with higher rendering quality, compared to state-of-the-art adaptive methods. We have demonstrated that our method outperforms previous methods numerically and visu- ally with high performance ray tracing kernels such as OptiX and Embree.},

Our technique supports arbitrary, non-convex, potentially textured polygonal lights. The shading time for the primary lighting pass in each of these config-urations is 2.4ms, 7.5ms, and 2.4ms, respectively. Timings are for an image resolution of 1920 \texttimes{} 1080 pixels, for the area-light shader only, without MSAA, with an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980 GPU. Abstract In this paper, we show that applying a linear transformation\textemdash{} represented by a 3\texttimes{}3 matrix\textemdash{}to the direction vectors of a spherical distribution yields another spherical distribution, for which we de-rive a closed-form expression. With this idea, we can use any spher-ical distribution as a base shape to create a new family of spheri-cal distributions with parametric roughness, elliptic anisotropy and skewness. If the original distribution has an analytic expression, normalization, integration over spherical polygons, and importance sampling, then these properties are inherited by the linearly trans-formed distributions. By choosing a clamped cosine for the original distribution we ob-tain a family of distributions, which we call Linearly Transformed Cosines (LTCs), that provide a good approximation to physically based BRDFs and that can be analytically integrated over arbitrary spherical polygons. We show how to use these properties in a real-time polygonal-light shading application. Our technique is robust, fast, accurate and simple to implement.},

Our approach uses standard GPU tessellation hardware and processes each face of a base mesh inde- pendently, thus allowing an entire model to be rendered in a single pass. The key idea of our method is to subdivide the u, v domain of each face ahead of time, generating a quadtree structure, and then submit one tessellated primitive per input face. By traversing the quadtree for each post-tessellation vertex, we are able to accurately and efficiently evaluate the limit surface. Our method yields a more uniform tessellation of the surface, and faster rendering, as fewer primitives are submitted. We evaluate our method on a variety of assets, and realize performance that can be three times faster than state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, our streaming formulation makes it easier to integrate subdivision surfaces into applications and shader code written for polygonal models. We illustrate inte- gration of our technique into a full-featured video game engine.},

  abstract = {With a photoreceptor mosaic containing ???85\% cones, the ground squirrel is one of the richest known mammalian sources of these important retinal cells. It also has a visual ecology much like the human's. While the ground squirrel retina is understandably prominent in the cone biochemistry, physiology, and circuitry literature, far less is known about the remodeling potential of its retinal pigment epithelium, neurons, macroglia, or microglia. This review aims to summarize the data from ground squirrel retina to this point in time, and to relate them to data from other brain areas where appropriate. We begin with a survey of the ground squirrel visual system, making comparisons with traditional rodent models and with human. Because this animal's status as a hibernator often goes unnoticed in the vision literature, we then present a brief primer on hibernation biology. Next we review what is known about ground squirrel retinal remodeling concurrent with deep torpor and with rapid recovery upon re-warming. Notable here is rapidly-reversible, temperature-dependent structural plasticity of cone ribbon synapses, as well as pre- and post-synaptic plasticity throughout diverse brain regions. It is not yet clear if retinal cell types other than cones engage in torpor-associated synaptic remodeling. We end with the small but intriguing literature on the ground squirrel retina's remodeling responses to insult by retinal detachment. Notable for widespread loss of (cone) photoreceptors, there is surprisingly little remodeling of the RPE or M??ller cells. Microglial activation appears minimal, and remodeling of surviving second- and third-order neurons seems absent, but both require further study. In contrast, traumatic brain injury in the ground squirrel elicits typical macroglial and microglial responses. Overall, the data to date strongly suggest a heretofore unrecognized, natural checkpoint between retinal deafferentiation and RPE and M??ller cell remodeling events. As we continue to discover them, the unique ways by which ground squirrel retina responds to hibernation or injury may be adaptable to therapeutic use.},

We greedily minimize relative mean squared error (MSE) by iterating over two steps. First, given a current sample distribution, we optimize over a discrete set of filters at each pixel and select the filter that minimizes the pixel error. Next, given the current filter selection, we distribute additional samples to further reduce MSE. The success of our approach hinges on a robust technique to select suitable per pixel filters. We develop a novel filter selection procedure that robustly solves this problem even with noisy input data. We evaluate our approach using effects such as motion blur, depth of field, interreflections, etc. We provide a comparison to a state-of-the-art algorithm based on wavelet shrinkage and show that we achieve significant improvements in numerical error and visual image quality. Our approach is simple to implement, requires a single user parameter, and is compatible with standard Monte Carlo rendering. \textcopyright{} 2011 ACM.},

Abstract Translucent objects such as fog, smoke, glass, ice, and liquids are pervasive in cinematic environments because they frame scenes in depth and create visually compelling shots. Unfortunately, they are hard to simulate in real-time and have thus previously been ren-dered poorly compared to opaque surfaces in games. This paper introduces the first model for a real-time rasterization algorithm that can simultaneously approximate the following trans-parency phenomena: wavelength-varying (" colored ") transmission, translucent colored shadows, caustics, partial coverage, diffusion, and refraction. All render efficiently on modern GPUs by us-ing order-independent draw calls and low bandwidth. We include source code for the transparency and resolve shaders.},

The early years of the 21st century have witnessed a tremendous growth in the use of digital images as a means for representing and communicating information. A considerable percentage of this literature is devoted to methods for improving the appearance of images, or for maintaining the appearance of images that are processed. Nevertheless, the quality of digital images, processed or otherwise, is rarely perfect. Images are subject to distortions during acquisition, compression, transmission, processing, and reproduction. To maintain, control, and enhance the quality of images, it is important for image acquisition, management, communication, and processing systems to be able to identify and quantify image quality degradations.

In this paper, we give a systematic, comprehensive and up-to-date review of perceptual visual quality metrics (PVQMs) to predict picture quality according to human perception. Several frequently used computational modules (building blocks of PVQMs) are discussed. These include signal decomposition, just-noticeable distortion, visual attention, and common feature and artifact detection. Afterwards, different types of existing PVQMs are presented, and further discussion is given toward feature pooling, viewing condition, computer-generated signal and visual attention. Six often-used image metrics (namely SSIM, VSNR, IFC, VIF, MSVD and PSNR) are also compared with seven public image databases (totally 3832 test images). We highlight the most significant research work for each topic and provide the links to the extensive relevant literature. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

To robustly estimate the optimal order, we propose a multi- stage error estimation process that iteratively estimates our recon- struction error. In addition, we present an energy-preserving outlier removal technique to remove spike noise without causing notice- able energy loss in our reconstruction result. Also, we adaptively allocate additional ray samples to high error regions guided by our error estimation. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by controlling the tradeoff between recon- struction bias and variance through locally defining our polynomial order, even without need for filtering bandwidth optimization, the common approach of other recent methods.},

Although these subtleties make the performance realistic and compelling, they often elude both motion capture and hand ani- mation.We present a technique for adding fine-scale details and expressive- ness to low-resolution art-directed facial performances, such as those cre- ated manually using a rig, via marker-based capture, by fitting a morphable model to a video, or through Kinect reconstruction using recent faceshift technology. We employ a high-resolution facial performance capture sys- tem to acquire a representative performance of an individual in which he or she explores the full range of facial expressiveness. From the captured data, our system extracts an expressiveness model that encodes subtle spatial and temporal deformation details specific to that particular individual. Once this model has been built, these details can be transferred to low-resolution art- directed performances. We demonstrate results on various forms of input; after our enhancement, the resulting animations exhibit the same nuances and fine spatial details as the captured performance, with optional temporal enhancement to match the dynamics of the actor. Finally, we show that our technique outperforms the current state-of-the-art in example-based facial animation.},

In this article we take a few steps in the direction of establishing such a foundation. Our approach is based on graphical perception-the visual decoding of information encoded on graphs-and it includes both theory and experimentation to test the theory. The theory deals with a small but important piece of the whole process of graphical perception. The first part is an identification of a set of elementary perceptual tasks that are carried out when people extract quantitative information from graphs. The second part is an ordering of the tasks on the basis of how accurately people perform them. Elements of the theory are tested by experimentation in which subjects record their judgments of the quantitative information on graphs. The experiments validate these elements but also suggest that the set of elementary tasks should be expanded. The theory provides a guideline for graph construction: Graphs should employ elementary tasks as high in the ordering as possible. This principle is applied to a variety of graphs, including bar charts, divided bar charts, pie charts, and statistical maps with shading. The conclusion is that radical surgery on these popular graphs is needed, and as replacements we offer alternative graphical forms-dot charts, dot charts with grouping, and framed-rectangle charts.},

This paper revisits this earlier work. Through exploratory pilot studies that expand Cleveland et al.'s experimental design, we develop an empirical model of slope ratio estimation that fits more extreme slope ratio judgments and two common slope ratio estimation strategies. We then run two experiments to validate our model. In the first, we show that our model fits more generally than the one proposed by Cleveland et al. and we find that, in general, slope ratio errors are not minimized around 45$^\circ$. In the second experiment, we explore a novel hypothesis raised by ourmodel: that visible baselines can substantiallymitigate errorsmade in slope judgments. We conclude with an application of our model to aspect ratio selection.},

Our methodology describes both the application requirements and the visualization techniques as profiles covering important aesthetic criteria for visualizing dynamic graphs. Characteristics of the graph and task are used to derive the application profile. The probably most appropriate visualization technique is the one whose profile matches best the required application profile. We compile exemplary visualization profiles for representatives of dynamic graph visualization approaches and demonstrate the methodology in a case study. \textcopyright{} 2013 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Connectomics is a field of neuroscience that analyzes neuronal connections. A connectome is a complete map of a neuronal system, comprising all neuronal connections between its structures. The term "connectome" is close to the word "genome" and implies completeness of all neuronal connections, in the same way as a genome is a complete listing of all nucleotide sequences. The goal of connectomics is to create a complete representation of the brain's wiring. Such a representation is believed to increase our understanding of how functional brain states emerge from their underlying anatomical structure. Furthermore, it can provide important information for the cure of neuronal dysfunctions like schizophrenia or autism. In this paper, we review the current state-of-the-art of visualization and image processing techniques in the field of connectomics and describe some remaining challenges.},

  abstract = {Visualization of dynamically changing networks (graphs) is a significant challenge for researchers. Previous work has experimentally compared animation, small multiples, and other techniques, and found trade-offs between these. One potential way to avoid such trade-offs is to combine previous techniques in a hybrid visualization. We present two taxonomies of visualizations of dynamic graphs: one of non-hybrid techniques, and one of hybrid techniques. We also describe a prototype, called DiffAni, that allows a graph to be visualized as a sequence of three kinds of tiles: diff tiles that show difference maps over some time interval, animation tiles that show the evolution of the graph over some time interval, and small multiple tiles that show the graph state at an individual time slice. This sequence of tiles is ordered by time and covers all time slices in the data. An experimental evaluation of DiffAni shows that our hybrid approach has advantages over non-hybrid techniques in certain cases.},

  abstract = {Data analysis applications typically aggregate data across many dimensions looking for anomalies or unusual patterns. The SQL aggregate functions and the GROUP BY operator produce zero-dimensional or one-dimensional aggregates. Applications need the N-dimensional generalization of these operators. This paper defines that operator, called the data cube or simply cube. The cube operator generalizes the histogram, cross- tabulation, roll-up, drill-down, and sub-total constructs found in most report writers. The novelty is that cubes are relations. Consequently, the cube operator can be imbedded in more complex non-procedural data analysis programs. The cube operator treats each of the N aggregation attributes as a dimension of N-space. The aggregate of a particular set of attribute values is a point in this space. The set of points forms an N-dimensional cube. Super-aggregates are computed by aggregating the N-cube to lower dimensional spaces. This paper (1) explains the cube and roll-up operators, (2) shows how they fit in SQL, (3) explains how users can define new aggregate functions for cubes, and (4) discusses efficient techniques to compute the cube. Many of these features are being added to the SQL Standard.},

  abstract = {Innovations in data visualization punctuate the landmark advances in human connectome research since its beginnings. From tensor glyphs for diffusion-weighted imaging, to advanced rendering of anatomical tracts, to more recent graph-based representations of functional connectivity data, many of the ways we have come to understand the human connectome are through the intuitive insight these visualizations enable. Nonetheless, several unresolved problems persist. For example, probabilistic tractography lacks the visual appeal of its deterministic equivalent, multimodal representations require extreme levels of data reduction, and rendering the full connectome within an anatomical space makes the contents cluttered and unreadable. In part, these challenges require compromises between several tensions that determine connectome visualization practice, such as prioritizing anatomic or connectomic information, aesthetic appeal or information content, and thoroughness or readability. To illustrate the ongoing negotiation between these priorities, we provide an overview of various visualization methods that have evolved for anatomical and functional connectivity data. We then describe interactive visualization tools currently available for use in research, and we conclude with concerns and developments in the presentation of connectivity results. \textcopyright{} 2013.},

  abstract = {One bottleneck in large-scale genome sequencing projects is reconstructing the full genome sequence from the short subsequences produced by current technologies. The final stages of the genome assembly process inevitably require manual inspection of data inconsistencies and could be greatly aided by visualization. This paper presents our design decisions in translating key data features identified through discussions with analysts into a concise visual encoding. Current visualization tools in this domain focus on local sequence errors making high-level inspection of the assembly difficult if not impossible. We present a novel interactive graph display, ABySS-Explorer, that emphasizes the global assembly structure while also integrating salient data features such as sequence length. Our tool replaces manual and in some cases pen-and-paper based analysis tasks, and we discuss how user feedback was incorporated into iterative design refinements. Finally, we touch on applications of this representation not initially considered in our design phase, suggesting the generality of this encoding for DNA sequence data.},

Participants were initially excited about the anticipated potential of visual data analysis for their work, but gradually discovered difficulties that eventually precluded a true integration of the visualization system into their daily work practices. These difficulties are unrelated to the specific visualization system used. We conclude that data analysts can take much better advantage of the benefits of information visualization systems when these systems are redesigned to be complementary products of current data analysis and workflow systems, rather than being stand-alone products as is currently the case. Our study offers some insights about how this complementarity can be achieved.},

  abstract = {Visualizing networks has become a very important research and application topic in the recent years, due to the availability of network data through the web, but also to the need of analyzing several types of networks such as computer networks, social networks, biological networks (e.g. gene similarities or biological pathways). Until 2000, the node-link diagram was the only representation used. However, this representation suffers from many readability issues when the network becomes dense. In 2003, we showed that the adjacency matrix representation was more effective to visualize networks when they were dense. We conducted a controlled experiment comparing how users performed on 9 important low-level tasks required for reading a network. We varied the density and the size of the networks and measured the time to complete and number of errors for each condition using a node-link diagram and a matrix. We had significant results for 8 of these tasks, proving that the matrix representation was more effective for large and dense networks, except for one task: path following. Indeed, the matrix representation is not good at finding paths between vertices whereas a correctly laid-out node-link diagram makes it easy on sparse networks and sometimes possible on denser ones.},

ZAME is based on an adjacency matrix graph representation aggregated at multiple scales. It allows analysts to explore a graph at many levels, zooming and panning with interactive performance from an overview to the most detailed views. Several components work together in the ZAME tool to make this possible. Efficient matrix ordering algorithms group related elements. Individual data cases are aggregated into higher-order meta-representations. Aggregates are arranged into a pyramid hierarchy that allows for on-demand paging to GPU shader programs to support smooth multiscale browsing. Using ZAME, we are able to explore the entire French Wikipedia - over 500,000 articles and 6,000,000 links - with interactive performance on standard consumer-level computer hardware.},
