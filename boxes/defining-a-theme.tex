The workshop theme summarizes the central topic of the workshop. Visualization creativity requirements workshops differ from workshops in other domains as their themes should aspire to:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
\item {\it Focus on interesting visualization opportunities} that identify a real need of analysts that exhibit the appropriate data location and task clarity~\cite{Sedlmair2012}.
\item {\it Identify relevant analysts and domain data,} necessary to invite participants and tailor workshop methods to explicitly incorporate questions about data, analysis, and visualization.
\item {\it Target results that benefit all project stakeholders,} including researchers, to better understand domain challenges, and collaborators, to think creatively about how they make sense of data.
